multi model ensembles

-difficult to assess multi-model ensemble uncertainty, or figure out best model to select
-a good approach seems to be finding an aspect of model sensitivity that relates strongly to desired predicted outcome, and see if you can constrain model using historical data

exploratory modeling
agent-based modeling
-simulating interactions between individuals using simple rules
-useful for understanding emergent behaviors without explicitly stating those behaviors as parameters or rules

perfect model studies
-'perfect' in terms of having 'perfectly' simulated data, not that the model is perfect.
-useful when you don't have data, or when you want to know what exact response will be under a perfect data scenario.
