Sensitivity Analysis
-read up on screening method

Morris' method
-Tries to deal with nonlinearity and interactions
-interactions and nonlinearities slightly different 
	-nonlinearity means effect of the value depends on the value itself (e.g. slope changes based on position)
	-interactions means effect of one value depends on other values
-can think of as individually randomized O-A-T experiments
-elementary effect is a function evaluated for n factors, then evaluate it again by changing value by delta, then dividing the difference between those two evaluations by delta
-how big should delta be?
-delta is a fixed value that should stay consistent throughout determining the elementary effect. effectively the 'jump size' between 
-pdf = probability distribution function
-cdf = continuous distribution function
-change your parameter values by delta in one dimension, then again by a diff. delta in a second dimension ... 
-do this k dimensions to understand the elementary effects on each dimension
-repeat this r times across the distribution of your data to effectively sample the k-dimensional parameter distribution space
-total # runs = (k+1)*r
-can use average, or average absolute value, to measure factor importance, and standard deviation to estimate the nonlinearity of effect.

Variance based methods
-doesn't fix how you step through the model - more based on random samples
-total uncertainty in y is measured as var(y)
-fix the value of one parameter and change every other parameter
	-then, measure the change in y variance when just that value is fixed
