introductory notes
-make sure to do the lapply from a for-loop assignment (from last r session)
-can set a seed for random number generation - set.seed(seedVal)
-using set seed if you want to control the sequence of random number. after a random distribution is sampled using a seed, a new seed is generated. can use the same seed to get same answer each time
-can use ks.test() to test if distributions are different

a brief review of the modeling process
-define the purpose of the model
	-to predict something, understand a process, etc.
-develop a conceptual model, or an abstraction first
	-just as important to understand was is included as excluded from the model
-select the model type and the scale
	-scale as temporal and spatial
-write code to implement your conceptual model
-estimate the 'free' parameters in your model - aka 'calibration'. 
	-tuning, fitting, parameterizing all synonyms used to describe calibration (at least for our purposes)
-evaluate model with sensitivity and uncertainty analysis.
-perform model validation, or evaluation. validation a bit tricky to use because it gives a sense of 'truth' to a specific set of data
	-use data that was NOT included in the calibration data set
-model application
	-prediction, inversion
	
-the above process is not strictly linear - there is often feedback between calibration and sensitivity analysis, balancing calibration and evaluation data, etc.
-conceptual models should be an explicit description of what is going into your model and how you believe interactions work within the model
-types of models - 
-mathematical
	-deterministic vs stochastic
	-analytical vs simulation
-spatial
	-distributed vs lumped
		-lumped means homogeneous model - doesn't specify explicitly where things happen in your extent
-temporal
	-dynamic vs static
-conceptual
	-mechanistic vs statistical
	-process-based vs statisical
	-bottom-up vs top-down
-nearly all models involve a level of empiricism
	-Y = F(X, beta)
	-Y is the output(s)
	-F is the form of the relationship
	-X is the model input(s)
	-beta is the model parameter(s)

some practical modeling tips
-must draw the line somewhere in terms of what variables are included in the model
-use lots of comments
