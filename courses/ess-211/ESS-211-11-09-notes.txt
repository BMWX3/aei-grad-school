post election - model performance

error sources
-input error (data bad)
-model error
  -structural / conceptual error (e.g. equations)
  -parameter error
-irreducible error (e.g. things you don't consider)

-model performance difficult to assess in a comparison situation where you can have different models with different parameters but get the same answer or similar agreement. difficult to assess without understanding how good your input data are.

model comparison takeaways
-test as much as possible with as many types of data as possible
-plot observed vs predicted
-use many metrics for evaluation, test against randomized references, other 'true' data

-will be talking about prediction uncertainty, reducing uncertainty with multi-model approaches, hindcasting, and applications for prediction
