ESS-211 10-3-16 notes

-models are abstract representations of a system or process
-ways to explore and add to our understanding of reality
-a way to communicate expertise without being present
-models are not reality, nor ar they a substitute for an experiment
-can be useful for designing experiments but shouldn't substitute them
-goals include: summarizing understanding by forcing abstractions; simulating virtual experiments; and making predictions; (et tu, above)
-modeling is not a goal in itself - they serve the goals above, and more, but they must be, at least, useful
-important in evn. sciences to manipulate measurements of models on widely varying temporal and spatial scales
-many factors not easily controlled, so experiments can be impossible
-many interacting system components (e.g. soil, precip, ecosystem, energy, etc.)
-warnings: all models are wrong- some are useful (attr. george box); done love any one model; use many models to find the reality they intersect;
-write up a checklist to review why you are building a model
-general uses - exploratory (to explore the implications of hypotheses) and predictive (estimating future or unobserved values that require estimates or uncertainties to be useful) modeling.
-building bad or toy models can be useful for exploration and for understanding data. not always useful for predictive modeling since your predictions will be meaningless
-can use literature to help define equations/parameters.
-does not have to be completely original
-use of data you dont already have not advised
-get early feedback to tune and tweak
-can make nominations for papers to discuss, principally ones that focus on sensitivity analysis, calibration, etc.
-definitions
-system is a set of interrelated components and relationships between them
-variable is a value that changes freely in space and time
-constant is a value that does not change (e.g. gravity)
-parameter is a value which is constant for a single case (e.g. model run) but may vary between cases.
-scale refers to grain and extent of a mnodel
-square root applied to variance to get stdev to return variance to the units we are interested in (since variance squares the residuals)
-standard error = sqrt(variance/n)
-random variables describe items that can have multiple, unknown values
-probability distribution describes shape of variability for a random variable
