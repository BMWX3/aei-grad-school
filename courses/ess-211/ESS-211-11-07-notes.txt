model evaluation cont'd

-models often evaluated by two criteria 
  -calibration - is the overall frequency of positive outcomes correct
  -discrimination - how confident is the model
-'expert political judgment' by tetlock sounds cool. apparently has a new book out now

taylor diagrams
-rmse and r-squared are closely related
-centered rmse is like rmse, but you subtract the means of predicted and of observed from each term (predicted sample and observed sample) 
-can make using 'plotrix' library

roc curves
-handles binary predictions 
-rocr is the r library
